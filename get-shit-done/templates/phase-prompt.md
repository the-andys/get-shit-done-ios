# Phase Prompt Template

> **Note:** Planning methodology is in `agents/gsd-planner.md`.
> This template defines the PLAN.md output format that the agent produces.

Template for `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md` - executable phase plans optimized for parallel execution.

**Naming:** Use `{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md` format (e.g., `01-02-PLAN.md` for Phase 1, Plan 2)

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `phase` | Yes | Phase identifier (e.g., `01-foundation`) |
| `plan` | Yes | Plan number within phase (e.g., `01`, `02`) |
| `type` | Yes | Always `execute` for standard plans, `tdd` for TDD plans |
| `wave` | Yes | Execution wave number (1, 2, 3...). Pre-computed at plan time. |
| `depends_on` | Yes | Array of plan IDs this plan requires. |
| `files_modified` | Yes | Files this plan touches. |
| `autonomous` | Yes | `true` if no checkpoints, `false` if has checkpoints |
| `requirements` | Yes | **MUST** list requirement IDs from ROADMAP. Every roadmap requirement MUST appear in at least one plan. |
| `user_setup` | No | Array of human-required setup items (external services) |
| `must_haves` | Yes | Goal-backward verification criteria (see below) |

**Wave is pre-computed:** Wave numbers are assigned during `/gsd:plan-phase`. Execute-phase reads `wave` directly from frontmatter and groups plans by wave number. No runtime dependency analysis needed.

**Must-haves enable verification:** The `must_haves` field carries goal-backward requirements from planning to execution. After all plans complete, execute-phase spawns a verification subagent that checks these criteria against the actual codebase.

---

## Parallel vs Sequential

<parallel_examples>

**Wave 1 candidates (parallel):**

```yaml
# Plan 01 - User feature
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified: [Sources/Features/User/UserModel.swift, Sources/Features/User/UserService.swift]
autonomous: true

# Plan 02 - Product feature (no overlap with Plan 01)
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified: [Sources/Features/Product/ProductModel.swift, Sources/Features/Product/ProductService.swift]
autonomous: true

# Plan 03 - Order feature (no overlap)
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified: [Sources/Features/Order/OrderModel.swift, Sources/Features/Order/OrderService.swift]
autonomous: true
```

All three run in parallel (Wave 1) - no dependencies, no file conflicts.

**Sequential (genuine dependency):**

```yaml
# Plan 01 - Auth foundation
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified: [Sources/Core/Auth/AuthManager.swift, Sources/Core/Auth/AuthMiddleware.swift]
autonomous: true

# Plan 02 - Protected features (needs auth)
wave: 2
depends_on: ["01"]
files_modified: [Sources/Features/Dashboard/DashboardView.swift]
autonomous: true
```

Plan 02 in Wave 2 waits for Plan 01 in Wave 1 - genuine dependency on auth types/middleware.

**Checkpoint plan:**

```yaml
# Plan 03 - UI with verification
wave: 3
depends_on: ["01", "02"]
files_modified: [Sources/Features/Dashboard/DashboardView.swift]
autonomous: false  # Has checkpoint:human-verify
```

Wave 3 runs after Waves 1 and 2. Pauses at checkpoint, orchestrator presents to user, resumes on approval.

</parallel_examples>

## Context Section

**Parallel-aware context:**

```markdown
<context>
@.planning/PROJECT.md
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
@.planning/STATE.md

# Only include SUMMARY refs if genuinely needed:
# - This plan imports types from prior plan
# - Prior plan made decision affecting this plan
# - Prior plan's output is input to this plan
#
# Independent plans need NO prior SUMMARY references.
# Do NOT reflexively chain: 02 refs 01, 03 refs 02...

@Sources/Relevant/SourceFile.swift
</context>
```

**Bad pattern (creates false dependencies):**
```markdown
<context>
@.planning/phases/03-features/03-01-SUMMARY.md  # Just because it's earlier
@.planning/phases/03-features/03-02-SUMMARY.md  # Reflexive chaining
</context>
```

---

## Scope Guidance

**Plan sizing:**

- 2-3 tasks per plan
- ~50% context usage maximum
- Complex phases: Multiple focused plans, not one large plan

**When to split:**

- Different subsystems (auth vs API vs UI)
- >3 tasks
- Risk of context overflow
- TDD candidates - separate plans

**Vertical slices preferred:**

```
PREFER: Plan 01 = User (model + service + view)
        Plan 02 = Product (model + service + view)

AVOID:  Plan 01 = All models
        Plan 02 = All services
        Plan 03 = All views
```

---

## TDD Plans

TDD features get dedicated plans with `type: tdd`.

**Heuristic:** Can you write `XCTAssertEqual(fn(input), expectedOutput)` before writing `fn`?
→ Yes: Create a TDD plan
→ No: Standard task in standard plan

See `~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/tdd.md` for TDD plan structure.

---

## Task Types

| Type | Use For | Autonomy |
|------|---------|----------|
| `auto` | Everything Claude can do independently | Fully autonomous |
| `checkpoint:human-verify` | Visual/functional verification | Pauses, returns to orchestrator |
| `checkpoint:decision` | Implementation choices | Pauses, returns to orchestrator |
| `checkpoint:human-action` | Truly unavoidable manual steps (rare) | Pauses, returns to orchestrator |

**Checkpoint behavior in parallel execution:**
- Plan runs until checkpoint
- Agent returns with checkpoint details + agent_id
- Orchestrator presents to user
- User responds
- Orchestrator resumes agent with `resume: agent_id`

---

## Examples

**Autonomous parallel plan:**

```markdown
---
phase: 03-features
plan: 01
type: execute
wave: 1
depends_on: []
files_modified: [Sources/Features/User/UserModel.swift, Sources/Features/User/UserService.swift, Sources/Features/User/UserListView.swift]
autonomous: true

## Anti-Patterns

**Bad: Reflexive dependency chaining**
```yaml
depends_on: ["03-01"]  # Just because 01 comes before 02
```

**Bad: Horizontal layer grouping**
```
Plan 01: All models
Plan 02: All services (depends on 01)
Plan 03: All views (depends on 02)
```

**Bad: Missing autonomy flag**
```yaml
# Has checkpoint but no autonomous: false
depends_on: []
files_modified: [...]
# autonomous: ???  <- Missing!
```

**Bad: Vague tasks**
```xml
<task type="auto">
  <name>Set up authentication</name>
  <action>Add auth to the app</action>
</task>
```

---

## Guidelines

- Always use XML structure for Claude parsing
- Include `wave`, `depends_on`, `files_modified`, `autonomous` in every plan
- Prefer vertical slices over horizontal layers
- Only reference prior SUMMARYs when genuinely needed
- Group checkpoints with related auto tasks in same plan
- 2-3 tasks per plan, ~50% context max

---

## User Setup (External Services)

When a plan introduces external services requiring human configuration, declare in frontmatter:

```yaml
user_setup:
  - service: apple-developer
    why: "Push notifications require APNs certificate and provisioning profile"
    xcode_config:
      - task: "Enable Push Notifications capability"
        location: "Xcode → Target → Signing & Capabilities → + Capability → Push Notifications"
      - task: "Select development team"
        location: "Xcode → Target → Signing & Capabilities → Team"
    dashboard_config:
      - task: "Create APNs key"
        location: "Apple Developer Portal → Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Keys → Create Key → Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)"
      - task: "Register App ID with push entitlement"
        location: "Apple Developer Portal → Identifiers → App IDs → Edit → Push Notifications → Enable"
    local_dev:
      - "Ensure device is registered in provisioning profile for testing"
```

**The automation-first rule:** `user_setup` contains ONLY what Claude literally cannot do:
- Apple Developer account enrollment (requires human signup)
- Provisioning profile and certificate management (requires Apple Developer Portal access)
- Xcode capability configuration (requires Xcode GUI interaction)
- Physical device registration (requires device UDID)
- App Store Connect configuration (requires human in browser)

**NOT included:** SPM dependency additions, code changes, file creation, xcodebuild commands Claude can run.

**Result:** Execute-plan generates `{phase}-USER-SETUP.md` with checklist for the user.

See `~/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/user-setup.md` for full schema and examples

---

## Must-Haves (Goal-Backward Verification)

The `must_haves` field defines what must be TRUE for the phase goal to be achieved. Derived during planning, verified after execution.

**Structure:**

```yaml
must_haves:
  truths:
    - "User can see existing messages in a scrollable list"
    - "User can send a message via the compose view"
    - "Messages persist across app relaunch (SwiftData/Core Data)"
  artifacts:
    - path: "Sources/Features/Chat/ChatView.swift"
      provides: "Message list rendering with SwiftUI"
      min_lines: 30
    - path: "Sources/Features/Chat/ChatViewModel.swift"
      provides: "Message business logic and state management"
      exports: ["ChatViewModel"]
    - path: "Sources/Models/Message.swift"
      provides: "Message model with SwiftData persistence"
      contains: "@Model class Message"
  key_links:
    - from: "Sources/Features/Chat/ChatView.swift"
      to: "Sources/Features/Chat/ChatViewModel.swift"
      via: "@StateObject or @State property"
      pattern: "@(StateObject|State).*ChatViewModel"
    - from: "Sources/Features/Chat/ChatViewModel.swift"
      to: "Sources/Models/Message.swift"
      via: "ModelContext query"
      pattern: "modelContext\\.(fetch|insert|delete)"
```

**Field descriptions:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `truths` | Observable behaviors from user perspective. Each must be testable. |
| `artifacts` | Files that must exist with real implementation. |
| `artifacts[].path` | File path relative to project root. |
| `artifacts[].provides` | What this artifact delivers. |
| `artifacts[].min_lines` | Optional. Minimum lines to be considered substantive. |
| `artifacts[].exports` | Optional. Expected exports to verify. |
| `artifacts[].contains` | Optional. Pattern that must exist in file. |
| `key_links` | Critical connections between artifacts. |
| `key_links[].from` | Source artifact. |
| `key_links[].to` | Target artifact or endpoint. |
| `key_links[].via` | How they connect (description). |
| `key_links[].pattern` | Optional. Regex to verify connection exists. |

**Why this matters:**

Task completion ≠ Goal achievement. A task "create chat component" can complete by creating a placeholder. The `must_haves` field captures what must actually work, enabling verification to catch gaps before they compound.

**Verification flow:**

1. Plan-phase derives must_haves from phase goal (goal-backward)
2. Must_haves written to PLAN.md frontmatter
3. Execute-phase runs all plans
4. Verification subagent checks must_haves against codebase
5. Gaps found → fix plans created → execute → re-verify
6. All must_haves pass → phase complete

See `~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/verify-phase.md` for verification logic.
